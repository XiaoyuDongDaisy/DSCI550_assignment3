## Methodology

#### Step1: D3 visualizations 

Select the plots we want from https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery . Then, we adjusted our data to fit and input into the existing visualization examples.
After, completing drawing the chart in the d3 website, we downloaded the codes of our d3 visualizations from the observable websites. unzipped the document and opened the terminal of this directory. In the terminal, we typed python -m http.server and opened http://localhost:8000/. 

Notice that : all D3 visualizations need to the webpage locally by using a webserver (to test) like python -m http.server <port> in the directory where the downloaded observable html and JSON locate.

```
python -m http.server 
```


#### Step8: Language detection by using Tikaâ€™s language identifier and Google LangDetect/Python
